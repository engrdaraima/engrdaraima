- 👋 Hi, I’m Daraima Bassey @engrdaraima
- 👀 I’m a data scientist and a serial entrepreneur.
- I'm currently advancing my career from an analyst to a machine learning engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for machine learning. Not like i have no experience with Python but i just want a more interesting experience I decided to start learning it again from "Hello World" 😂 This time not about data visualization but everything focused on machine learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science related projects, analytics programming, and machine learning projects. So I'm going to be sharing my code on here from "Hello World" to my very first machine learning model. 
- 📫 How to reach me? LinkedIn seems like a perfect fit. I'll update my contact info as time goes on.
- 😄 Pronouns: 😅 I identify as a coat. 😂 Not really sure what that means in the pronoun world but when everything gets cold i can keep my python code warm. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also teach English 😁 I own a digital marketing company and nobody has ever beaten me in local SEO because I kinda figured out how to use data science in local SEO. 😂
- 🥸 Yes You guessed it right I'm not quite young. I'm starting Python all over again in my late 20s 😂 I wrote my first HTML code over 10 years ago. Spent the entire time on JavaScript DOM, got scolded by C, 😅 Fell in love with Ruby, discovered python, but used R studios for data analysis 😅. Programming was more of a hobby to me. Besides web development and Data analytics i only use programming as entertainment.
- 🫣 Oh is AI replacing programmers? 😂 Lol, AI depends on programmers and that dependence will rather grow. The only problem is that the standards have increased meaning you need to know more as a programmer today than you needed 10 years ago. Exactly why i want to focus on what's sweetest --> Creating AI systems.
